COMP 20: Lab 8
==============
By: Sam Hollingsworth

Purpose of this Git repository:
-------------------------------
  To display the work I have completed for the course COMP 20: Web Programming, making it easy for the instructors to view and grade my work.
  
Favorite Lab or Assignment:
---------------------------
  I most thoroughly enjoyed completing Lab 4: Responsive Design, because I had to look more into media queries on my own in order to complete the lab and I enjoyed learning on my own, then successfully implementing what I learned.
  Also, I had never previously thought about how a web page changes based on the size of the browser, so learning about how that is implemented was fascinating as well being able to do it on my own was very cool.
  
How much do you think you have grown?:
--------------------------------------
  I have obviously grown in my knowledge of the topics covered like HTML and JavaScript, and I think I have grown a considerable amount in those fields because
  before this course I had 0 background in either. Also, I have grown in terms of learning on my own, because it is an important skill and one that is necessary for any comp class.
  All in all, I have seen a noticeable growth from when I started to now for the better in terms of the knowledge I gained and the skills I learned.

What was the most important thing you learned?:
-----------------------------------------------
  I think the most important thing I learned was JavaScript because it is such a powerful tool to use in web programming shown in all the assignments we have done that involve it and when I am applying to summer internships one of the main requirements I see is a background in JavaScript so I'm glad I took this course as it gave me a good starting point for learning the language.

What topic would you like to delve deeper into?:
------------------------------------------------
  Web security, I have taken COMP 116 and I still think its one of the most interesting fields in computer science and would like to learn more about it as it is such a huge and fascinating field.
