	<p>By Sam Hollingsworth</p>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>



	<h2>Methodology</h2>



	<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>



	<h2>Issues Found</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>Issue: Cross-Site Scripting</p>
			<p>Location: XSS result can be found at https://thawing-hamlet-47380.herokuapp.com</p>
			<p>Severity: Medium since a user can effect the experience of another</p>
			<p>Description: When data is sent to the app in the fields login, latitude, and longitude the app does not remove special characters before inserting into the database.
				So when the checkins are listed on the homepage, the script written by the user is executed and results in an alert.

			<p>Proof of Vulnerability:

			<p>Resolution: Remove special characters from data before inserting into database</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<p>Issue: mongoDB injection</p>
			<p>Location: https://thawing-hamlet-47380.herokuapp.com/checkins.json</p>
			<p>Severity: High because someone you can view all the checkins of everyone that has checked in, allowing them to see every location the other users have been</p>
			<p>Description: Using the mongoDB injection, https://thawing-hamlet-47380.herokuapp.com/checkins.json?login[$ne]="Sam", allows someone to access all the checkins for the other users since $ne means not equal
				and will find all the usernames not equal to "Sam"</p>
			<p>Proof of Vulnerability:
				<img id="mongoDBi" src="mongoDBi.png" alt="Picture of mongoDBi"/></p>
			<p>Resolution: Install something like Sqreen in the Node.js app to prevent from mongoDB injections that does data validation on user input</p>
